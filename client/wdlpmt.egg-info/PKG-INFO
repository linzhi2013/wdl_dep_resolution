Description: # extractfq
        
        ## 1 Introduction
        
        `extractfq` is a tool to extract some fastq reads from the beginning of the files.
        
        ## 2 Installation
        
            pip install extractfq
        
        There will be a command `extractfq` created under the same directory as your `pip` command.
        
        ## 3 Usage
        
            $ extractfq
            usage: extractfq.py [-h] [-fq1 <str>] [-fq2 <str>] [-outfq1 <str>]
                                [-outfq2 <str>] [-size_required <float>] [-rl <int>] [-gz]
                                [-cache_num <int>]

              -fq1 <str>            input fastq 1 file
              -fq2 <str>            input fastq 2 file
              -outfq1 <str>         output fastq 1 file
              -outfq2 <str>         output fastq 2 file
              -size_required <float>
                                    size required in Gigabase. [3]
              -rl <int>             read length required. discard the smaller ones, and
                                    cut the longer ones to this length [None]
              -gz                   gzip output. [False]
              -cache_num <int>      the cache number of reads before writing to the file,
                                    to speed up. the larger of cache_num, the more memory
                                    (default is ca. 2G) will be used. [1500000]
